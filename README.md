# Script-based-WFH-hacks
Scripts to help your WFH efforts (help you, not your employer ;))


As of the present time, scripts in the powershell folder do not require admin permissions to use. If I develop scripts that do require elevated permissions, I will make a new sub-folder. 




If you enounter issues, have questions, or want to give suggestions, I am available at the following email address: overstock_taekwondo429@simplelogin.com
